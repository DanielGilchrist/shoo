# shoo

A CLI utility for managing GitHub notifications with configurable filtering rules.

## Installation

TODO: Write installation instructions here

## Usage

```bash
# Filter notifications based on your configuration
shoo notification purge
```

## Configuration

Create `~/.config/shoo/config.yml`:

```yaml
github:
  token: "your_github_token_here"  # Optional, can use SHOO_GITHUB_TOKEN env variable instead

notifications:
  purge:
    # Global rules (apply to all repos unless overridden)
    global:
      keep_if:
        author_in_teams: ["core-team", "security-team"]
        authors: ["DanielGilchrist", "trusted-maintainer"]
        mentioned: false

    # Repo-specific rules (override global)
    repos:
      "my-org/critical-repo":
        keep_if:
          author_in_teams: ["core-team"]
          mentioned: true

      "my-org/experimental-repo":
        keep_if:
          authors: ["DanielGilchrist"]
```

## How it works

Shoo will always keep notifications for:
- PRs/issues you authored (`reason="author"`)

Additionally, it will keep notifications from PRs/issues where:
- The author is in your `authors` list
- The author is a member of teams listed in `author_in_teams`
- You were mentioned and `mentioned: true` is set

All other notifications (like CI activity, comments from irrelevant users) will be marked for purging.
